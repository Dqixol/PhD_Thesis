      abstract = {This paper considers the decay of a standard model Higgs boson into a tau pair, as a possible signature at the SSC or LHC for a Higgs boson of mass between 110 and 160 GeV. The production of the Higgs in association with a large transverse momentum jet is considered, since this may aid in reconstructing the Higgs mass. The background from the production of tau pairs via virtual photons and Z's is studied. We comment on the possible use of this process to search for a light Higgs at the Tevatron collider.}
