      abstract={Particle physics has arrived at an important moment of its history. The discovery of the Higgs boson has completed the Standard Model, the core theory behind the known set of elementary particles and fundamental interactions. However, the Standard Model leaves important questions unanswered, such as the nature of dark matter, the origin of the matter--antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, and the existence and hierarchy of neutrino masses. To address these questions and the origin of the newly discovered Higgs boson, high-energy colliders are required. Future generations of such machines must be versatile, as broad and powerful as possible with a capacity of unprecedented precision, sensitivity and energy reach. Here, we argue that the Future Circular Colliders offer unique opportunities, and discuss their physics motivation, key measurements, accelerator strategy, research and development status, and technical challenges. The Future Circular Collider integrated programme foresees operation in two stages: initially an electron--positron collider serving as a Higgs and electroweak factory running at different centre-of-mass energies, followed by a proton--proton collider at a collision energy of 100 TeV. The interplay between measurements at the two collider stages underscores the synergy of their physics potentials.},

abstract = {Results are presented from the ATLAS collaboration from the 2010 LHC heavy-ion run, during which nearly ten inverse microbarns of luminosity were delivered. Soft physics results include charged particle multiplicities and collective flow. The charged particle multiplicity, which tracks initial state entropy production, increases by a factor of 2 relative to the top RHIC energy, with a centrality dependence very similar to that already measured at the RHIC. Measurements of elliptic flow out to large transverse momentum also show similar results to what was measured at the RHIC, but no significant pseudorapidity dependence. Extensions of these measurements to higher harmonics have also been made and can be used to explain structures in the two-particle correlation functions that had long been attributed to jet–medium interactions. New hard probe measurements include single muons, jets and high pT hadrons. Single muons at high momentum are used to extract the yield of W± bosons and are found to be consistent within statistical uncertainties with binary collision scaling. Conversely, jets are found to be suppressed in central events by a factor of 2 relative to peripheral events, with no significant dependence on the jet energy. Fragmentation functions are also found to be the same in central and peripheral events. Finally, charged hadrons have been measured out to 30 GeV, and their centrality dependence relative to peripheral events is similar to that found for jets.}

abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.}

An overview of the major modifications to the accelerator and its systems is followed by a summary of the results of the superconducting magnet training campaign to increase the LHC operation energy beyond the maximum value of 6.5 TeV reached during Run 2. The LHC configuration and the scenarios for proton and ion operation for Run 3 are presented considering the expected performance of the upgraded LHC Injectors and the proton beam intensity limitations resulting from the heat load on the cryogenic system due to beam-induced electron cloud and impedance.}
