# PhD Thesis (ATLAS) Repository

Welcome to my PhD thesis repository! This repository contains all the LaTeX files, scripts, and configurations necessary to compile a PhD thesis that meets ATLAS guidelines and takes full advantage of the official ATLAS LaTeX bells and whistles. The structure is designed to be modular and easy to navigate, so you can either clone this repository as a template for your own work or explore it to see how everything is organized.

## How to Compile
   You can compile using your preferred method:
   - Using the Makefile:
     ```bash
     make
     ```

   After successful compilation, you should get a `thesis.pdf` containing the fully formatted ATLAS Thesis.

## Usage

- If you want to use this as a template for your own thesis, simply customize the content within the `src` directories. 
- Feel free to rename `thesis.tex` if you prefer a different entry point.
- Make sure you credit the ATLAS collaboration resources if you reuse the styles or macros for other documentation.

## Contributing

If you notice any errors or want to suggest improvements (like additional macros, CI scripts for automated compilation, or better organization), feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Since this repository is primarily meant for my PhD thesis, major changes might not be merged, but all feedback is welcome.

## License

You are welcome to explore and adapt the LaTeX code here. However, ATLAS-specific style files are subject to the collaborationâ€™s terms of use. Please check with the ATLAS collaboration or any official documentation regarding redistribution or modification of the ATLAS style files.
